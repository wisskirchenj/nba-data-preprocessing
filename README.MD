# Preprocessing of NBA data with Pandas

Project implemented in the track 'Pandas for Data Analysis' of hyperskill.org JetBrains Academy.

## Technology / External Libraries

- Python 3.12.3,
- with packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pytest
- Poetry 1.8.3

## Repository Contents

The sources of main project tasks (4 stages) and pytest testing.

## Program description

Data preprocessing is one of the first steps in the machine learning workflow. The main idea is to transform raw data
into a format that machine learning algorithms can easily understand. The predictive performance of a machine learning
model highly depends on the input data quality. Thus, it's an absolute must to know how to improve the quality of your
input data by removing the features with low predictive value, engineering new ones, and dealing with multicollinearity.
With this project, we apply these concepts to NBA data to get a high-quality dataset ready to be fed to a linear
model!

Have fun!
